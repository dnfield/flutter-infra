# Flutter LUCI Service Configurations

Contains configuration and tools related to Flutter's build infrastructure.

Configuration is generated by `lucicfg`, which is part of `depot_tools`. Rather
than updating the individual .cfg files, updates should be made to
`config/main.star`. That file can then be run to regenerate the configuration.

## Forcing the propagation of these configurations

One may speed up the propagation of these configuration files by visiting the
[luci-config web UI](https://luci-config.appspot.com/), logging in, and
searching for projects/flutter. From there, one may click on the
projects/flutter search result and click the download icon to force an update.
